<h3>PRIVACY STATEMENT</h3>
This Privacy Statement covers Netball Australia Limited and each of its related companies and subsidiaries, including Netball World Cup Sydney 2015.

<strong>1. Protecting Privacy and application of this Privacy Policy</strong> <br>
1.1 Netball Australia Limited (Netball Australia) is the governing body of netball in Australia. Netball Australia manages and promotes various 
netball programs, events and activities. <br>
1.2 In its role as the governing body of Netball in Australia, Netball Australia is committed to the protection of your personal information in 
accordance with the National Privacy Principles set out in the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth). <br>
1.3 In Australia, Netball programs, events and activities are implemented and conducted by a number of different netball organisations across the 
country. Accordingly, Netball Australia has developed this privacy policy to apply to each Australian Netball Organisation (ANO). <br>
1.4 For the purpose of this policy, each of the following is an ANO: <br>
a) Netball Australia, <br>
b) Netball World Cup Sydney 2015 <br>
c) Member Associations, being the governing body of netball in each Australian State and Territory known as Netball ACT, Netball Victoria, Netball

d) Affiliated Organisations, being those organisations (other than Member Associations, Regional Associations and Affiliated Clubs) which are 
affiliated to Netball Australia from time to time in accordance with its constitution, <br>
e) Regional Associations, means those regional or metropolitan netball associations which are members of, or affiliated to, a Member Association, 
<br>
f) Affiliated Clubs, being those netball clubs, which are a member of or affiliated to a Regional Association and/or Member Association, <br>

non-affiliated netball organisation, this privacy policy will not apply. <br>
1.7 Netball Australia may, from time to time, review and update this privacy policy to adapt to changing business practises, and to take into account

policy, posted on the www.netball.asn.au website. <br>
<br>
